# Syncthing

This HELM chart creates an instance of Syncthing in Gold and GoldDR, however it does require some manual setup once the components are in place.

## Initial Install
The Helm chart will install required components listed below and then guide you through the setup
- Deployment 
- Network Policy
- PVC
- Service
- TransportClaim (Only installed on Gold)

### Helm Install
1. Navigate to the infrastructure folder in your CLI
1. Login to oc for Gold
1. `helm install dev-drivebc-syncthing -f ./syncthing/values-dev.yaml ./syncthing`
1. Login to oc for GoldDR
1. `helm install dev-drivebc-syncthing -f ./syncthing/values-dev.yaml -f ./syncthing/values-dev-dr.yaml ./syncthing`
1. Everything is now installed and you should be able to go to the routes.

### Connecting the Syncthing Instances
Once you have installed the HELM chart, follow these steps:
1. Open the Route on both Gold and GoldDR
1. You should be prompted to login using the oAuth Proxy (if you have access to the namespace, you will have access to this)
1. Click `No` for `Allow Anonymous Usage Reporting?`
1. Click `OK` for `GUI Authentication: Set User and Password`
1. In both
    1. Click `Actions`
    1. Click `Advanced`
    1. Under GUI, Check `Insecure Admin Access` (We put the GUI behind the oAuth Proxy instead of using local credentials)
    1. Under Options, uncheck `Announce LAN Addresses` and `Crash Reporting Enabled`
    1. Save
1. In both
    1. Click `Actions`
    1. Click `Settings`
    1. Device Name:
        1. In Gold set to: `ENV-drivebc-gold` (ie dev-drivebc-gold)
        1. In GoldDR set to: `ENV-DriveBC-GoldDR`
    1. Go to `Connections` Tab 
        1. Uncheck `Enable NAT traversal`, `Global Discovery`, `Local Discovery` and `Enable Relaying`

    1. Advanced Tab
        1. In your CLI for Gold
            1. Run `oc get endpoints`
            1. It should return a name of `ENV-drivebc-syncthing-golddr` for which you will need to note the IP and Port
        1. In the `Addresses` field, enter the IP and port from above in: `tcp://<IP>:<PORT>` format (ie tcp://142.34.64.62:1516)

    1. Advanced Tab
        1. In your CLI for Gold
            1. Run `oc get endpoints`
            1. It should return a name of `ENV-drivebc-syncthing-gold` for which you will need to note the IP and Port
        1. In the `Addresses` field, enter the IP and port from above in: `tcp://<IP>:<PORT>` format (ie tcp://142.34.64.62:1516)

1. All set! The folders should be syncing


## Upgrades
From time to time you may need to change things like the Syncthing Version, oAuthProxy version, resources, PVC size, etc. 
In that case, update the values file for your environment and run
- Gold: `helm upgrade dev-drivebc-syncthing -f ./syncthing/values-dev.yaml ./syncthing`
- GoldDR: `helm install dev-drivebc-syncthing -f ./syncthing/values-dev.yaml -f ./syncthing/values-dev-dr.yaml ./syncthing`


## Sysdig
Syncthing exports various metrics using prometheus which can be viewed in Sysdig. This allows you to setup dashboards and alerts.
